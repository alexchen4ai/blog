To run the language model faster and especially on the edge devices, we need to optimize the model. This optimization can be done in different ways. In this article, we will discuss some of the optimization techniques. In this blog, I will introduce different methods and the existing solutions to enable the language model to run faster. Note that my focus is for the on-device language model.

## Overview of the optimization
To optimize the inference for language model, we mainly have the following methods:

1. **Quantization**: Quantization is the process of reducing the precision of the weights and activations of the model. This reduces the memory footprint and increases the speed of the model.
2. **Pruning**: Pruning is the process of removing the weights that are close to zero. This reduces the number of parameters in the model and increases the speed of the model.
3. **Lower level implementation**: Implementing the model in a lower level language like C++ or Rust can increase the speed of the model.
4. **KV Cache**: Key-Value cache is a technique to cache the intermediate results of the model. This reduces the computation and increases the speed of the model. For some certain devices, we may need to support the KV cache specially. 
5.
